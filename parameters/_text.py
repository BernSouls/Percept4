"""parameters/_text.py -- the canonical parameter text (Move 7b).

Byte-for-byte the former parameters.py. Executed exactly once, in the
original statement order, so every intra-file dependency
(e.g. THETA_FERTILE_PROTECT = 0.1 * RF_MAX) resolves as it did before
the split. Nothing else in this package re-defines a constant; the
view modules only re-export names from here.

Naming convention: constants use SPEC NAMES where the spec provides one.
Greek letters map to English names (τ→TAU, θ→THETA, κ→KAPPA, ε→EPS, λ→LAMBDA,
η→ETA, α→ALPHA, β→BETA, γ→GAMMA). Module prefixes are NOT added; if a
spec name is unique across all sections, it is used bare. Collisions are
handled by section context or explicit disambiguating suffixes.

# [V3] The CALIBRATED fusion weights (label-free).
#
# Each group is weighted by the product of two MEASURED, LABEL-FREE
# quantities, both computed by diagnostics/_calibrate.py on the dev split:
#   reliability    -- the group's mean similarity between an image and its
#                     OWN perturbed version (shift, scale, gain, blur, noise);
#   distinctiveness-- 1 - (the mean off-diagonal similarity) / (the mean
#                     diagonal similarity) over the dev corpus: how far the
#                     group separates different images.
# The weight is reliability x distinctiveness, normalised over the groups
# that are present. NO LABEL is used in the derivation, so no label can leak
# into the representation. A label-based calibration is reported separately
# as a DIAGNOSTIC UPPER BOUND only.
# Provenance: rule = "a noisy group must not dilute an informative one";
# data source = the ETH-80 dev split (6 instances per class, 3 views);
# date 2026-10-20; mechanism version descriptor-v3.
# The VALUES below are the calibration's output (diagnostics/_calibrate.py,
# manifest diagnostics/_calibration_manifest.json). Reliability is the mean
# self-similarity under shift / scale / gain / blur / noise; distinctiveness
# is the LABEL-FREE nearest-neighbour margin (how far the best other item
# beats the mean of the rest), normalised by the group's similarity range;
# the weight is their product, normalised:
#   shape       reliability 0.7538  distinctiveness 0.1703  -> 0.1939
#   arrangement reliability 0.7565  distinctiveness 0.1792  -> 0.2048
#   surface     reliability 0.9039  distinctiveness 0.1574  -> 0.2149
#   layout      reliability 0.7856  distinctiveness 0.3256  -> 0.3863
# The layout group has the largest margin (it separates the most), so it
# leads; the surface group is the most reliable; the shape group is stable
# but uninformative, so it is quiet.
# (These are the values measured WITHOUT the orientation-anisotropy term in
# the layout's similarity: with that term the layout alone rose but the
# fused arm fell, so the term was dropped and the calibration re-measured
# for the configuration that ships.)
# [RETIRED] The chain-based shape group is retired from the fusion (weight
# 0): a chain's members change with the view, so the group diluted the
# informative ones. Its measurement is still stored on the descriptor (the
# chain's graded population), and the PEAK-FRAGMENT group -- the same
# measurement rebuilt on the peaks, which recur across views -- replaced it.

#
# THEIR WEIGHTS come from the SAME label-free calibration as every other

# earn its weight is retired to 0, exactly as the pair histogram was.

# The per-group CORPUS NULL correction stays OFF for these groups too: the
# null correction was MEASURED to cost 0.099 overall (0.7604 against 0.8599

# one bin apart produced distinct nodes and were never treated as the same
# content. This caused the 1-bit quantization trap: a bin-boundary wobble
# across the class appears as two disjoint class-specific nodes, inflating
# both `disc` values. Clustering content nodes by similarity θ_cluster
# merges near-identical signatures into one node.
#
# Semantics: when a content signature arrives, resolve it to the nearest
# existing cluster centroid of the same lens type whose similarity is at
# least θ_cluster. If found, join that cluster (update centroid as running
# mean). If not found, create a new cluster seeded by this signature.
#
# θ_cluster is on TypedSignature.similarity's scale. Given the current
# flat similarity calibration (~0.05 per bin on a 20-range), θ_cluster=0.90
# merges signatures within ~2 total bin units and is the default.
# Env-overridable so the sweep does not require an edit per point.

# consolidator._find_best_extension (node-extension AND edge-extension sites):
#     key = (round(score / _EVID_TIE_GRID), tb)
# It must sit strictly BETWEEN float noise and the smallest real score gap:
#   * above float jitter (~1e-11), so nondeterministic last-bit differences
#     land in the same bucket and the content hash resolves them;
#   * below the smallest observed positive top-two gap
#     (2.7604159041905163e-08 at seeds 0 and 42, on the graded-param tree
#     after the Pass-23 edge vocabulary landed: probe's distinct margin
#     values = 17 per seed, so param_sim genuinely varies), so genuine
#     distinctions stay in different buckets and the hash never overrules
#     the score.
# The earlier coarse value (1.38e-08, from a pre-calibration gap of
# 1.38e-07) left only a 2x margin below the then-current min gap -- and a
# coarser grid (e.g. 0.0017857) would bucket both members of such a
# top-two pair together and hand the decision back to the hash --
# reintroducing the bug for exactly the near-ties that matter most.
# Derivation: min_positive_gap / 10 = 2.76e-08 / 10. DO NOT tune this
# against benchmark numbers -- it is a determinism guard. A grid at or above
# the minimum real gap collapses every score into one bucket and turns
# selection into a pure hash lottery, reintroducing (worsening) the bug this
# exists to fix. If a future probe run reports a smaller minimum positive
# gap, re-derive it (min_gap / 10) instead of hardcoding.

#     The draft's B.15 was written against a v9 Gabor bank that does not exist
#     in this tree. The v9 Gabor path uses GABOR_N_THETA below (12) and must
#     never shadow a live name; a helper needing a different theta count gets a
#     distinct name.
#   1 was dropped by ruling: MCS_SPECIFICITY_SCALE — B.13 forbids the
#     coverage x specificity form in the same document, and the constant's only
#     consumer was that form (tried in 619e16c, reverted in 6b18560).
#
# NAMING ADJACENCY — read before touching either constant:
#   JUNCTION_MAX_GAP (3.0) / JUNCTION_T_PERP_TOL (0.15) below are the v9
#   parameters for primitives.detect_junctions (the 5-tuple T/Y/X classifier,
#   B.1). They are NOT the tree's v9-era T-junction detection pair —
#   T_JUNCTION_MAX_GAP (6.0) / T_JUNCTION_MAX_PERP_DEV (0.5, parameters.py:312)
#   — which are read by sensory_floor._detect_t_junctions (the 4-tuple
#   detector used by binder._run_occlusion). Two functions, two schemas, two
#   thresholds. Fixing "the" junction constant without checking which detector
#   reads it is the ABSORPTION_MIN_MIN_SIM trap (B.27) again.
#
# Fingerprint expectation for this commit: EMPTY (constants only; nothing
# reads them yet).

#
# The cocircular fan's rays deviate from the reference axis by
# `half = asin(AF_PERP_FRAC / AF_LONGITUDINAL_MULT)` (perception/
# contour_field.py), and the alternate-segment theorem turns that deviation
# into a predicted orientation `theta_ref + 2*joff`: the fan's ORIENTATION
# EXCURSION is therefore 2*half.
#
# The limit used to be a FREE constant (0.35 rad) that no geometry
# produced, so the fan could be refused for being narrow (the comparison
# was inverted) or allowed for being wide, and the two numbers could
# disagree. The limit is now the BANK'S OWN ORIENTATION RESOLUTION: the
# angular gap between two adjacent Gabor orientation channels. A fan whose
# predicted orientation stays inside that gap names a direction the bank
# can still resolve as local to the reference; beyond the gap it reads a
# channel that is not the reference's neighbourhood at all.
#
# The two numbers now come from ONE geometry -- the excursion is derived
# from the AF constants, the limit is derived from the bank -- so they
# cannot disagree. The admission condition is exactly
#     AF_PERP_FRAC / AF_LONGITUDINAL_MULT <= sin(pi / (2 * GABOR_N_THETA))
# i.e. 0.1 <= 0.1305 for the shipped constants, so the derived fan
# (2*half = 0.2003 rad) is admitted by the derived limit (0.2618 rad).

# output is byte-identical before and after the change).

#
# The peak's STRENGTH and COHERENCE slots are graded quantities with a
# SPAN (the "clip"): the bin is floor(value / span * 8) and the graded
# population bump is centred on the same continuous position. The spans
# were free constants taken from a STALE measurement (5 images, an older
# field formula): STRENGTH_CLIP = 20 with a claimed p50 of 17.0 (so the
# top bin was a saturated plateau) and COHERENCE_CLIP = 0.15 with a
# claimed max of 0.147 (so the axis barely used its span).
#
# RULE: the span of a graded slot is the measured MAXIMUM of the quantity
# over the real corpus -- the quantity's own range end, which is what
# perception/contour_peak.py has always documented ("bin edges are chosen
# from these observed ranges; anything outside the range is clipped to the
# nearest edge"). Nothing is fabricated and nothing is tuned: a value
# outside the corpus's range (a new frame, a different corpus) is clipped
# to the edge, which is the declared behaviour of a clip.
#
# MEASUREMENT (the data source of the two constants below): 4200 field
# peaks over 16 real ETH-80 frames (8 classes x 2 instances, canon 256,
# the PRODUCTION luminance), measured by

#   integration_strength: min 0.0194, p01 0.391, p10 2.802, p50 3.238,

# The OLD coherence clip saturated the population: with 0.15, 72 % of the
# measured peaks (p50 = 0.1527) landed in the TOP bin, so the coherence
# slot carried one level for most of the population. The strength
# distribution is strongly bimodal (a bulk at ~3.2 and a thin tail to

# point whose cheapest escape to the frame crosses no edge must read 0
# (exterior) -- but the raw magnitude, normalised by its 95th percentile,
# puts the background's noise at ~0.3 of the scale, so EVERY escape paid
# extra cost and the field saturated (measured: 87% of a real frame at
# enclosure > 0.99, and 0 of 2137 captured parts had any flank support).
# Re-measured on synthetic corpora (diagnostics/enclosure_sat_probe.py),
